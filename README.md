## ðŸ›  Features

### Task A: Supplier Data Cleaning & Joining
- Implemented in Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/Task_A.ipynb`)
- Cleans and merges two supplier datasets into a unified inventory.

### Task B: RFQ Similarity Analysis
- Implemented as a modular Python pipeline (`scripts/Task_B/`)
- Finds top-3 similar RFQs for each request.

**Modules:**
- `data_loader.py`
- `grade_normalizer.py`
- `range_parser.py`
- `feature_engineering.py`
- `similarity_calculator.py`
- `run.py`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Task A (Jupyter Notebook)

```bash
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook Task_A.ipynb
```
Run all cells to generate the cleaned inventory dataset.

### 3. Run Task B (Python Pipeline)

```bash
cd scripts/Task_B/
python run.py
```
This will execute the similarity analysis and save results to `results/top3.csv`.

## ðŸ“¦ Output Files

- **Task A:** `results/inventory_dataset.csv` â€” Unified supplier data
- **Task B:** `results/top3.csv` â€” Top-3 similar RFQs for each request
